  description: The Department of Managed Health Care approached SymSoft Solutions
    about redesigning their public-facing website. Their old website did not use current
    web technologies, nor did it have a mobile component. The new site was designed
    around requirements gathered and information from the DMHC about their communication
    priorities. Designed to be easier for California consumers to navigate, it includes
    responsive media queries that allow the layout to adapt to mobile devices as well
    as tablets. My role was to develop the responsive design, the look and feel of
    the website and to code the HTML and CSS. **Final Product Property of Symsoft
